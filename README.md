The goal of this ČVUT FIT (university) module was to learn how to develop algorithms to solve basic problems and how to convert these 
algorithms into programs in the C programming language. 💻

Next goal was to learn practical skills in program testing and debugging. 🛠

Course graduate (me) understands data types (primitive, pointers, structures), statements, expressions, 
and functions in the C language. ⚙️

I understood the principles of recursion and algorithm complexity. 👨🏽‍💻

Finally, I learned the basic algorithms for searching, sorting and linked lists processing. ⌨️
