# My C Programming University Projects 👨🏽‍💻

## 🗄️ Repository structure: 📁
* Each folder corresponds to a separate project. 
* In each folder you will find:
    * `... .c`: file with the program code.
    * `README.md`: auxiliary file with a detailed description of the task.

## Technology Stack: 🔍
- **Language:** C
- **Tools and Techniques:**
  - **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C programs.
  - **GDB**: GNU Debugger for debugging C programs.
  - **Make**: Utility for managing project builds.
  - **Valgrind**: Tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.
  - **Data Structures:** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues and trees.
  - **Algorithms:** Sorting (quick sort), searching (binary search), and others.
  - **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
  - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.

## Course Goals: 📍
- **Algorithm Development:** Learn how to develop algorithms to solve problems.
- **C Programming:** Convert algorithms into C programs.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Gain practical skills in program testing and debugging.

## Obtained Skills: 🤔
- **Data Types:** Work with primitive data types, pointers, and structures.
- **Control Structures:** Use statements, expressions, and functions.
- **Recursion:** Apply recursion and evaluate algorithm complexity.
- **Algorithms:** Work with search, sorting, and data structure algorithms.

## Repository Overview: 🗄️
This repository contains various projects completed as part of university coursework in C programming. Each project folder contains the source code and a `README` file with detailed descriptions of the tasks and objectives.
