---

## 👋🏼 Greetings! 👋🏼

This repository contains my university projects completed in the C programming language. 🔧

---

## 📍 Course goals: 📍

* Learn how to develop algorithms to solve problems. 🧠
* Convert algorithms into C programs. 💻
* Gain practical skills in program testing and debugging. 🛠

---

## 🤔 My obtained skills: 🤔

* Work with data types (primitive, pointers, structures). ⚙️
* Use statements, expressions, and functions. 🧮
* Apply recursion and evaluate algorithm complexity. 👨‍🏫
* Work with search, sorting, and linked list algorithms. 🗃

## 🗄️ Repository structure: 🗄️

* Each folder corresponds to a separate project. 📁
* In each folder you will find:
    * ... .c: file with the program code. 💾
    * README.md: auxiliary file with a detailed description of the task. 📃
